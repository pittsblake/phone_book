# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:


* About
A place to store contacts. Did not get the chance to get the Twilio api in use, but would like to implement it to have the ability to message contacts. Also, I still need to put validations on the phone-number so that the number only contains integers and is restricted just 10 digits.


* Technologies
- React
- Ruby on Rails 
- Devise

* Deployment instructions
